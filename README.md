# FizzBuzz

## What is this project?

Fizz Buzz is a program that prints out every number between 1 and 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3,
print out Fizz instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, print out Buzz instead of the
number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print out FizzBuzz instead of the number.
